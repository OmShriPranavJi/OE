Key information to include:

[Detail 1, e.g., 'Product features: made from recycled materials, keeps drinks hot for 6 hours']
[Detail 2, e.g., 'Webinar Date: June 15th, 2 PM EST']
[Call to Action, e.g., 'Shop now!', 'Read the full story on our blog', 'Register here: [Link]']
(Optional) Desired tone: [e.g., 'enthusiastic and friendly', 'professional and informative']
(Optional) Relevant hashtags to consider: [e.g., '#sustainableliving', '#businessgrowth']
Please make the posts concise and engaging for the chosen platform.</pre>

                            <pre>Review the drafted social media post options for [Social Media Platform] regarding [Purpose of posts] [or paste the drafts here]. Now, enhance these posts in ONE of the following ways:

1. Suggest Accompanying Visuals: For each of the post options, briefly describe the type of image, graphic, or short video clip that would best complement the text and enhance its appeal on [Social Media Platform].

2. Incorporate an Interactive Element: Rewrite ONE of the posts to include a direct question to the audience, a simple poll (if the platform supports it), or a "fill-in-the-blank" statement to encourage comments and interaction.

3. Create A/B Testing Variations for One Post: Take ONE of the post options and create two slightly different versions (Variant A and Variant B). The variations could be in the hook/opening line, the call to action, or the primary benefit highlighted. Label them clearly for A/B testing.

4. Adapt for a Different Platform: Take ONE of the drafted posts for [Original Social Media Platform] and adapt its tone, length, and any relevant features (like hashtags or tagging conventions) to be suitable for [Different Social Media Platform, e.g., 'Twitter/X', 'Instagram Stories', 'a company blog snippet'].</pre>
