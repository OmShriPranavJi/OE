3. Evoke a Specific Emotional Response: Choose ONE of the promotional campaign themes. Suggest 2-3 specific angles or messaging approaches that would aim to evoke a particular emotion in the target audience (e.g., for a theme of 'Spring Refresh,' angles to evoke 'excitement,' 'relief,' or 'inspiration').

4. Integrate Clear Calls to Action: For three of the generated content ideas (blog or social media), suggest a specific and relevant call to action (CTA) that should accompany each piece of content.</pre>
