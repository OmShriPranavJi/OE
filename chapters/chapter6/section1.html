                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>You have clear larger goals for your business – perhaps for the quarter or even the year. However, the path from that big-picture vision to a concrete set of day-to-day actions can seem murky.</p>
                    <p>Large goals can feel overwhelming and it's hard to know where to begin, leading to procrastination or unfocused effort.</p>

                    <h2>The AI Prompt Solution</h2>
                    <p>Use AI as your strategic decomposer. By presenting a larger goal to the AI, you can get assistance in breaking it down into smaller, more manageable, and actionable tasks or mini-projects. This makes the overall objective feel less daunting and provides a clearer roadmap for execution.</p>

                        <h4>Why it Works</h4>
                        <p>This prompt encourages you to articulate your main goal clearly. The AI then helps to dissect it into more granular components, transforming an intimidating objective into a series of achievable steps. This structured approach makes it easier to plan and track progress.</p>

                        <pre>Act as a project planning assistant. My business, [Your Business Name], has a key goal for this [Timeframe, e.g., 'quarter', 'next 6 months']: [Clearly state your Business Goal, e.g., 'to increase online sales by 20%', 'to launch our new consulting service package', 'to improve our customer retention rate by 10%'].

To achieve this, I believe key areas to focus on might include [mention 1-3 broad areas if you have them, e.g., 'enhancing our website's user experience', 'developing a targeted marketing campaign', 'improving post-purchase follow-up'].

Please help me break this overall goal down into 5-7 smaller, actionable tasks or mini-projects. For each task:

Suggest a clear task description.
(Optional) Identify a potential first step for that task.
(Optional) Suggest a rough timeframe or priority level (e.g., high, medium, low for the next 30 days).</pre>

                        <pre>Review the list of actionable tasks generated to achieve the goal of "[Your Business Goal]" [or paste the list here]. Now, enhance this list in ONE of the following ways:

1. Identify Key Resources Needed per Task: For each of the main tasks identified, suggest 1-2 essential types of resources that would likely be required for its successful completion (e.g., "Specific software access," "Budget for X," "Expertise in Y," "Collaboration from Z team member").
2. Brainstorm Potential Obstacles & Mitigation Ideas: For three of the most critical tasks in the list, brainstorm one potential (but common) obstacle that might hinder its progress and suggest a simple, proactive mitigation idea for each.
3. Define a "Success Indicator" for Each Task: For each task, propose one clear and simple success indicator – how will you know this specific task has been completed effectively and has achieved its intended micro-outcome?
4. Reframe a Task for Clear Delegation: Choose one complex task from the list. Rephrase its description, objective, and key steps as if you were clearly and concisely delegating it to a capable team member, ensuring they have all necessary context.</pre>
