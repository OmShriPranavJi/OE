                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Your mind is buzzing with ideas – for a new service, a marketing campaign, improvements to a process, or content for a presentation.</p>
                    <p>However, these thoughts can often feel scattered, making it difficult to translate them into a coherent structure or an actionable plan.</p>

                    <h2>The AI Prompt Solution</h2>
                    <p>Think of AI as your organizational partner. It can help you take a jumble of brainstormed thoughts and group them into logical themes, create outlines for projects or presentations, and bring structure to your creative process.</p>
                </div>

                        <p>This prompt allows the AI to act as an objective sorter. It can identify relationships between disparate ideas that you might miss when you're too close to the brainstorming process, helping to bring clarity and order.</p>

My raw ideas are:

[Idea 1, e.g., 'Welcome email series']
[Idea 2, e.g., 'Personalized demo call']
[Idea 3, e.g., 'Checklist for new clients']
[Idea 4, e.g., 'Video tutorials for key features']
[Idea 5, e.g., 'Dedicated onboarding specialist']
[Idea 6, e.g., 'Feedback survey after 30 days']
[Add as many ideas as you have]
Please:

Group these ideas into logical categories or themes.
For each category, provide a brief heading.
Suggest a potential order or flow if these were to be implemented.</pre>

                            <pre>Review the categorized and structured list of ideas related to [Topic] [or paste it here]. Now, analyze this list further in ONE of the following ways:

1. Identify "Quick Wins" vs. "Strategic Initiatives": For each category or major idea, classify it as either a potential "Quick Win" (relatively easy to implement, likely to show visible results quickly) or a "Strategic Initiative" (may require more resources/time but has significant long-term impact).

2. Suggest Potential Dependencies: Review the ideas and identify any obvious dependencies between them (e.g., "Idea A must be completed before Idea B can start").

3. Generate "How Might We..." Questions: For each main category of ideas, formulate one or two "How Might We..." (HMW) questions that could be used to spark more detailed brainstorming or problem-solving related to that theme. (e.g., If a category is "Improve Communication," a HMW could be "How might we make our weekly updates more engaging for clients?").

4. Brainstorm Potential KPIs/Success Metrics: For 2-3 of the key ideas or categories, suggest one potential Key Performance Indicator (KPI) or success metric that could be used to measure its effectiveness if implemented.</pre>

I have approximately [e.g., '30 minutes for the presentation / This is a small internal project'].

Please generate a logical outline with main sections and potential sub-points for each.

For a presentation, suggest where I might include an introduction, key examples, and a call to action.

For a project, suggest phases or key deliverable areas</pre>

1. Suggest Audience Engagement Techniques (for Presentations): For 2-3 key sections in the presentation outline, suggest a specific, simple audience engagement technique (e.g., "Ask a quick poll question here," "Share a brief, relatable anecdote to illustrate this point," "Pause for a 1-minute 'reflect and jot down' activity").

2. Identify Key Resource Requirements (for Projects): For each major phase or section in the project outline, list 1-2 probable key resources that would be needed (e.g., "Personnel: Graphic Designer," "Budget: Software Subscription," "Tool: Project Management Platform," "Information: Competitor Analysis Data").

3. Propose Methods for Measuring Success/Impact: Add a final section to the outline titled "Measuring Success." Suggest 2-3 ways the success of this [project/presentation] could be gauged or its impact measured (e.g., "Post-presentation survey for understanding," "Project: Number of leads generated," "Project: Reduction in X by Y%").

4. Offer an Alternative Structural Flow: Suggest one significantly different structural flow or organizational approach for the content in the outline. For example, if the current outline is chronological, suggest a problem/solution structure, or a thematic approach. Briefly explain the potential benefit of this alternative.</pre>
