Please draft a clear, concise, and comprehensive answer to this question that I can use as a template. The answer should aim to:

Directly address the core question.
Include key details such as [mention 2-3 specific details the answer must cover, e.g., for payment terms: 'accepted payment methods, due dates, any late fee policies' or for onboarding: 'initial steps, typical timeframe, what they need to provide'].
Be written in a friendly and easy-to-understand manner.
(Optional) Point to where they can find more detailed information if applicable (e.g., 'a link to your full terms and conditions page').</pre>

                            <pre>Review the drafted FAQ template answer for "[Common Client Question]" [or paste the answer here]. Now, enhance this template in ONE of the following ways:

1. Embed Links to Specific Resources: Identify 1-2 places in the answer where a hyperlink to a more detailed guide, a relevant blog post, a video tutorial, or a specific page on your website could be beneficially inserted. Specify where the links should go and what the anchor text might be.

2. Anticipate and Answer the "Next Question": Based on this FAQ, what is the most likely follow-up question a client might have? Draft a brief answer to that anticipated next question, which could be appended to the original answer or kept as a ready secondary response.

3. Create an Ultra-Concise Version: Condense the main points of the FAQ answer into a very short (1-2 sentence) version suitable for a quick reply in a live chat or a social media direct message.

4. Add a "Helpfulness Check": Include a closing line that encourages feedback on the answer itself, such as: "Was this answer helpful? If you have more questions or need further clarification, please let us know!"</pre>
