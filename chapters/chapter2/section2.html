                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>You need to share important information with your team – a new policy, the kick-off for a significant project, or even just a general company update.</p>
                    <p>However, ensuring these announcements are read, understood, and don't cause confusion, or a barrage of follow-up questions can be challenging.</p>
                    <p>Emails get buried, and poorly worded memos create more questions than answers.</p>

                    <h2>The AI Prompt Solution</h2>
                    <p>Use AI to help you craft internal communications that are clear, concise, and easy to understand.</p>
                    <p>By guiding the AI with the key information and desired tone, you can create announcements that hit the mark the first time.</p>

                    <h4>Why it Works</h4>
                    <p>This prompt structures the information logically, ensuring all critical aspects of the new policy are covered. Specifying the tone helps the AI craft a message that is more likely to be well-received by the team.</p>

                    <pre>Act as a clear and empathetic Head of [Your Department/Company Leader]. I need to draft an internal announcement to all team members about a new company policy.

Policy Topic: [e.g., 'Updated Work-From-Home Guidelines']
Key Changes/New Guidelines to Communicate:

[e.g., 'Minimum 2 days per week in the office for all full-time staff, effective [Start Date]']
[e.g., 'Core collaboration hours when in office are 10 AM to 4 PM']
[e.g., 'Requests for exceptions must be submitted to [Manager/HR] by [Date]']
Reason for the New Policy (briefly): [e.g., 'To enhance team collaboration and in-person mentoring opportunities']

Where to find more detailed information: [e.g., 'The full policy document is available on the company intranet at [Link]']

Who to contact with questions: [e.g., 'Please direct any questions to your direct manager or HR']

The tone should be informative, positive, and understanding of potential questions or concerns.</pre>

                    <h3>Refining Your Policy Announcement – Thinking Laterally</h3>
                    <p>Once the AI generates the initial policy announcement, you might want to make it more digestible, preempt questions, or plan its dissemination more effectively.</p>

                    <div class="refiner-why-works">
                        <h4>The Goal of this Refiner</h4>
                        <p>To enhance the clarity and reception of the policy announcement by adding supporting elements or adapting it for different contexts.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="refiner-explanation">
                        <h4>Why This Refiner Works</h4>
                        <p>It helps you think beyond the initial message to how it will be received and understood.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Option 1 proactively addresses confusion and reduces follow-up questions.</li>
                            <li>Option 2 helps ensure the message reaches everyone effectively.</li>
                            <li>Option 3 provides a quick, digestible summary for busy team members.</li>
                            <li>Option 4 can improve the positive reception of the new policy by highlighting "What's In It For Me."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="refiner-expected-outcome">
                        <h4>Expected Enhanced Outcome for You</h4>
                        <p>A policy announcement that is not only clear but also supported by FAQs, a dissemination strategy, or framed to enhance employee understanding and acceptance, leading to smoother policy implementation.</p>

                    <div class="prompt-code">

                        <pre>Review the policy announcement draft [or paste the draft here]. Now, enhance it in ONE of the following ways:

Generate a Mini FAQ Section: Based on the new policy details provided in the announcement, anticipate 3-5 likely questions employees might have and draft concise, clear answers for each. Add this as an FAQ section to the end of the announcement.

Suggest a Multi-Channel Communication Plan: Briefly outline 2-3 other ways this policy announcement could be communicated to the team (besides this main email/memo) to ensure everyone receives and understands it (e.g., "Discuss in next all-hands meeting," "Post summary on company chat #announcements channel," "Add to new employee onboarding checklist").

Create a "Key Takeaways" Summary: Extract the absolute most critical points (3-4 bullets) from the announcement that represent the "must-know" information for employees. This could be used as a preamble or a quick reminder.

Reframe to Emphasize Employee Benefits (WIIFM): Review the "Reason for the New Policy" and other details. Rewrite parts of the announcement to more strongly emphasize any direct or indirect benefits for the employees (e.g., "This change to X will also help ensure Y for you..."), if applicable, to improve buy-in.</pre>

                    <h4>Why it Works</h4>

The announcement should cover:

Excitement for the project: Briefly state the project's importance/potential impact.
Project Goal(s): Clearly state what the project aims to achieve.
Key Team Members & Roles (if not widely known or if specific roles are crucial for this project): [e.g., 'Sarah - Lead Designer, Tom - Backend Developer, Me - Project Oversight']
High-Level Timeline/Key Milestones (briefly): [e.g., 'Phase 1 (Discovery) - Next 2 weeks, Phase 2 (Development) - 6 weeks']
Date/Time for Kick-off Meeting (if applicable): [e.g., 'Our official kick-off meeting is scheduled for [Date] at [Time] via [Link/Location]']
A call to action/statement of collaborative intent: (e.g., "I'm looking forward to working with all of you to make this a huge success!")
The tone should be motivating and informative.</pre>

                        <pre>Review the project kick-off announcement [or paste the draft here]. Now, build upon it in ONE of the following ways:

Draft Initial "Team Success" Metrics: Based on the project goals, suggest 2-3 potential "success metrics" specifically from the team's perspective. What would make them feel this project was a collaborative success (e.g., "Clear communication throughout," "Meeting internal deadlines smoothly," "Positive cross-functional feedback")? These can be discussion starters.

Generate Kick-off Meeting Engagement Questions: Create 3 open-ended questions related to the project announcement that can be asked during the kick-off meeting to encourage immediate participation and gather initial thoughts from the team (e.g., "What excites you most about this project?", "What's one potential challenge you foresee that we should discuss early on?", "What's one critical piece of information you feel you need to get started effectively?").

Create a "Project Elevator Pitch" for the Team: Condense the key information about the project (goal, impact, timeline) into a very brief (2-3 sentences) "elevator pitch." This is something team members can use to quickly and consistently describe the project's purpose to others not directly involved.

Suggest Initial "Ways of Working" Points: Based on the project type, draft 2-3 bullet points for discussion about "Ways of Working" for this specific project team (e.g., "Preferred communication channel for quick updates?", "Frequency of check-in meetings?", "Process for flagging roadblocks?").</pre>
